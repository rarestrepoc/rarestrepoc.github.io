## About me

My name is Ronald Restrepo, I have a degree in Mining and Metallurgy Engineering from the Faculty of Mines of the National University of Colombia. I studied an Applied Data Science specialization at the University of Michigan.

I plan to focus my working life on data science because it is a subject that I am passionate about; topics such as machine learning, data mining and decision making.

I have worked on some data analysis, data visualization and machine learning model projects using python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, Sckit-Learn, among others.

## Projects

### Data Analysis
- [Clean and merge data from multiple sources and answer a few questions](./Project_1.html)



You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/rarestrepoc/rarestrepoc.github.io/edit/main/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/rarestrepoc/rarestrepoc.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
